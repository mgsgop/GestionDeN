## Custom Widget for [Wakanda](http://wakanda.org)
The __BarCode__ widget uses the js library JsBarcode developped by  https://github.com/lindell

### Properties
This widget __BarCode__ has the following properties: 

* __value__: The data binding value of the widget
* __format__: The barcode format ('EAN (13)',  'CODE128 (B)', 'UPC-A', 'CODE39', 'ITF14') 

### Goals
The __BarCode__ is a draggable widget that you can add to your wakanda pages. Once added in your page, you can bind a datasource by dragging the datasource property directly into the widget or by adding the datasource property name in the value field. 

Any value associated will be transformed into a barcode. You could also bind the widget with a calculated attribute.
